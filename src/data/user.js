	about: {
		title: "My Story üìñ",
		description:
			"Born in Seoul, South Korea, and raised in the heart of Canada‚Äôs tech hub, Waterloo, I grew up surrounded by innovation and big ideas. From a young age, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how things work, whether it‚Äôs understanding the principles behind a strategy, analyzing financial systems, or exploring the mechanics of everyday gadgets. That curiosity eventually led me to studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo, where I get to blend my love for both worlds. Along the way, I‚Äôve built software that solves real-world problems, from streamlining insurance claim processes to optimizing investment portfolios with data-driven strategies. I enjoy taking complex problems and finding efficient, practical solutions, whether that‚Äôs through designing intuitive front-ends, building scalable back-ends, or applying data analysis techniques. But beyond the code, I‚Äôm all about balance. You‚Äôll find me playing soccer, lost in a great music playlist, or grabbing a bite with my friends. I find that stepping away from the screen often leads to the best ideas. At the end of the day, I believe in the power of innovation to make a lasting impact, and I‚Äôm always looking for opportunities to contribute to solutions that matter. If you‚Äôre passionate about creating meaningful change, let‚Äôs connect.",
